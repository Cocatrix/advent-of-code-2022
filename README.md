# advent-of-code-2022

Let's have fun

Private leaderboards where I'm included:

- https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/private/view/124480
- [coming soon]

100% Swift with playgrounds - Kotlin next year ;)

I have prewritten tool functions for parsing, logging, they will be in each solution in separated files for clarity

To read the solutions, you can browse `master` by commit, or focus on `Solution.swift` files
